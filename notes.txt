beam = swing arm
short arm is the side closer to the counterweight
long arm is the side closer to the payload

critical design ratios
mass ratio Mcw : Mp should be 100:1
arm length ratio: Llong : Lshort typically 3.75:1 to 4:1
sling length: roughly equal to Llong


todo:
maybe change all references to arm to beam for consistency
